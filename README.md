# Python-Video-Quality-Metrics

Objective video quality models were created to predict digitally encoded video quality. This
is achieved through a number of validation tests. With this, objective measures can be
identified and contrasted with users' opinions of video quality. Once this is accomplished, the
measures that most closely correlate with the opinions of users are selected. Video quality
models can be sorted into three different categories: FullReference (FR), NoReference (NR)
and ReducedReference (RR).
